# Aircraft Minimization for Timetable Optimization

## Overview
This is a pet project that showcases a single optimization algorithm designed to minimize the number of aircraft required for a given flight timetable. Airlines and aviation companies can significantly reduce operational costs and environmental impact by efficiently managing their fleet utilization.

## Minimum Path Cover Algorithm

At the core of this project is the Minimum Path Cover algorithm. It is tailored to efficiently solve the Minimum Path Cover problem in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This algorithm plays a pivotal role in optimizing the allocation and utilization of aircraft to minimize the number of aircraft required for a given flight timetable.
